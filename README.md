# python_db 🖥️

### Introduction
This is a super basic program that mimicks a database using python, it's also a project for me to retain what I'm learning from python and to gain some experience using Git as opposed to actually contributing a working database! - ⚙️📚

### Features 
A project using sql lite to make a pretend database, it starts empty but you can add and remove as many entries as you'd like!, The layout follows a simple Name, Age and Occupation format and is automatically indexed using sql lite! 

### Working on
In the next update I plan to make the server acessible from computers on multiple networks. Maybe it's also time to look for some GUI? - 💾

## Bugs
I haven't implemented any feature to catch and work around wrong input types when using the database. Sometimes the program will not find the 'data.db' file but if you're opening this up in vscode or in a similar ide make sure to open the entire folder and that'll fix it! - 🐛
