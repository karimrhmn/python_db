# python_db 🖥️

### Introduction
This is a super basic program that mimicks a database using python commands, it's also a project for me to retain what I'm learning from python and to gain some experience using Git as opposed to actually contributing a working database! - ⚙️📚

### Features 
A dictionary holding index numbers that is indexed in this format "1: {Name: ---, Age: ---, Occupation: ---}". - 📖  
The current features are to view the dictionary, add an entry and to remove an entry. - 💽

### Working on
My next step is to make the program read and write to a text file that way it is possible to actually save the data. - 💾
